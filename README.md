# Data Structures, Algorithms, and Problem Solving Practice

This repository documents my journey learning Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) and practicing problem-solving, primarily using platforms like LeetCode. The goal is to build a strong foundation in core computer science concepts and improve programming proficiency across multiple languages.

## Purpose

*   **Learn & Implement:** Understand fundamental Data Structures (Linked Lists, Trees, Hash Tables, etc.) and Algorithms (Sorting, Searching, Graph Traversals, DP, etc.) by implementing them from scratch.
*   **Problem Solving:** Solve coding challenges from platforms like LeetCode to apply DSA knowledge and develop problem-solving patterns.
*   **Multi-Language Exploration:** Implement solutions in Python initially, with the intention of revisiting problems and implementing them in other languages (like C++, Java, etc.) to understand language-specific nuances and trade-offs.
*   **Personal Reference:** Serve as a personal knowledge base and code library for future reference.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized to keep concepts, implementations, and practice problems distinct and easy to navigate, especially with multiple languages in mind.
